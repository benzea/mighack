= Introduction =

mighack is a small preload library that makes it possible to move GTK+
applications to a different X server and/or screen. It works by adding a
signal called "screen_migrate" to GtkWindow by hooking into creation of
the GtkWindow class. This signal is similar to the "screen" property, but
takes a string like "localhost:10.0".

Not that as the name suggests, this is a hack. I think a window manager
integration makes more sense in the long run. But it is a nice little
hack :-)


= Getting mighack =

mighack is available with git from http://git.sipsolutions.net/mighack.git.


= Usage =

To use the hack you need to load mighack.so by exporting it in for example
your ~/.gnomerc with:

export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/lib/mighack.so


Just adding a signal of course is not enough, to use the hack you also need
to add a keybinding to trigger the screen migration. To do this write
something like the following into your ~/.gtkrc-2.0:

binding "migration_hack" {
# Cycle trough the screens with Ctrl+Escape, the list of screens is
# separated with '#'
  bind "<ctrl>Escape" { "screen_migrate" ("localhost:22.0#:0.0") }

# Explicitly switching to a specific screen with <ctrl>F1 or F2
  bind "<ctrl>F1" { "screen_migrate" (":0.0") }
  bind "<ctrl>F2" { "screen_migrate" ("localhost:22.0") }
}

class "GtkWindow" binding "migration_hack"


With the above snippet you can migrate windows between localhost:22.0 and
localhost:0.0 by either pressing Ctrl+Escape or Ctrl+F1/F2.

In some enviroments ~/.gtkrc-2.0 may be an auto generated file. If this is
the case, it will usually include a file called ~/.gtkrc.mine or similar.
If that is not the case, you can also just create a new file and add it
to the GTK2_RC_FILES enviroment variable.


= Bugs =

I am not aware of any problems with the code itself. However the screen
migration is not very reliable. Many applications will not work at all
(epiphany, evolution) and others have problems (gnome-terminal stays blank).

It does work fine with gedit and evince. I successfully migrated them
between my main screen and an Xnest.
